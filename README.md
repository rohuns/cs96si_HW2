# Assignment 2 - *HealthFinder++*

**HealthFinder** is a mobile client app that leverages the [HealthFinder API](https://healthfinder.gov/Developer/How_to_Use.aspx#) which is maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services.

Time spent: 2.5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] User can search for HealthFinder topics using a UISearchBar
- [ ] User can show and hide filter controls using a UISwitch
- [ ] User can use a UIPickerView to select an age
- [ ] Delegates/Protocols are used to update the searching functionality

For some reason GIPHY records 30 seconds but only lets you view 15 of those 30 seconds on their link which due to length
of time the API Request takes is not enough. I have added the gif to the github, but it may be easier to just clone and run
the code on your own machine

## Notes
Did not run into many. Had to unwrap the delegate when I was passing it to the HealthFinderFiltersView Controller, which was confusing but not too bad
